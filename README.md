## 📌 Overview

CampusCycle is a full-stack web application that enables university students to share and exchange resources within the campus community.

Students can list unused items such as textbooks, kitchen equipment, tools, and other resources for others to borrow. The platform promotes sustainability, cooperation, and community building.

This project aligns with the theme:

> “Sharing, exchange and building community.”

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Many students have unused items while others cannot afford to buy them. There is currently no structured, secure university-focused platform for cooperative sharing.

CampusCycle provides a database-driven web platform that enables students to connect and exchange resources without financial transactions.
